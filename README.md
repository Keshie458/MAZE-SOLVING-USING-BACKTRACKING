Maze Solver using Backtracking
Overview
This project implements a maze solver using the backtracking approach. The solver is capable of finding a path from the start to the end of a maze of varying complexities. It also includes a visualization tool to help understand how the backtracking algorithm navigates the maze.

Features
Backtracking Algorithm: A recursive algorithm to explore all possible paths in the maze.
Maze Visualization: A graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame to visualize the maze and the path found by the solver.
Performance Analysis: Evaluation of the algorithm's performance in terms of execution time and memory usage for different maze sizes and complexities.
Backtracking Algorithm
The backtracking algorithm works by exploring each possible path from the start to the goal. If it hits a dead end, it backtracks and tries another path. This process continues until a path to the goal is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
